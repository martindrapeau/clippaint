Clip Paint - Paint in the Browser
---
https://clippaint.com/

# Motivation
Clip Paint is a JavaScript tool reproducing MS Paint selection capabilities in the Browser.
I use it to create screenshots for blog posts and bug reporting.
It is work in progress. Currently, selection capabilities work.
To be added are drawing figures and text.

# Running locally
Fork and clone the repo. Then simply open the index.html file in your browser.

# Extending
The entire app is contained within one file `app.js`. It is self documented.
Clip Paint does depend on a number of other libraries. These are:
- Bootstrap 4
- jQuery 3 (slim version)
- FontAwesome 4
- svg.js and a few plugins
- hermite.js for image resize
- download.js to download image
